### Node-State: A finite state machine (FSM) implementation for Node.js

Node-State is intended as a rough port of the Akka FSM module for Scala.  While other FSM implementation exist for Node, none seemed to offer the flexibility and the clear DSL offered by Akka.  This project is an attempt at bringing that to the Node world.
